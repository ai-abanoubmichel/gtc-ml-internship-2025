This repository contains the projects I worked on during my **Machine Learning Internship** at **Genius Technology Center (GTC)**.  
The focus was on applying the **end-to-end ML workflow**: data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. Hotel Booking Cancellations Prediction
- **Objective**: Analyze hotel booking data to predict customer cancellations.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
  - EDA to discover insights (e.g., seasonal trends, customer behavior).  
  - Model training & evaluation using classification algorithms.  
- **Results**: Expanded the project scope from basic cleaning & EDA to full model training and performance evaluation.  
- üìé [View Project]([[./Hotel_Bookings](https://github.com/ai-abanoubmichel/gtc-ml-project1-hotel-bookings)](https://github.com/ai-abanoubmichel/gtc-ml-project1-hotel-bookings.git))

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict passenger survival using demographic and travel data.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
  - Model training & evaluation using classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).  
- **Results**: Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- üìé [View Project](./Titanic)
